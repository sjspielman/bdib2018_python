## Part I: Functions

1. Write a function to compute the `GC` content of a DNA sequence. The function should accept a single argument, the DNA sequence, and return the GC *percentage*. Test your function with the nucleotide sequence `"AGCTATAGCATAGC"`.

2. Write a function that calculates the percentage of a given nucleotide from a DNA sequence. The function should accept two arguments: the nucleotide of interest and the DNA sequence. It should return the nucleotide percentage. Test your function with the nucleotide sequence `"AGCTATAGCATAGC"`.

3. Write a function that calculates the percentage each nucleotide in a given DNA sequence. of a given nucleotide from a DNA sequence. The function should accept a single argument, the DNA sequence, and return *a dictionary* containing `key:value` pairs of `nucleotide:percentage`. You can assume that the provided sequence contains only A, C, G, T. Test your function with the nucleotide sequence `"AGCTATAGCATAGC"`.

4. Write a function to guess whether a provided sequence is DNA or protein. For this task, assume that any sequence comprised of $$\geq50$$% A, C, G, T is a DNA sequence. Test your function with the following two sequences:
	+ `"AGCTATGCATACGAGCATAGC"`
	+ `"AGIILLCPKLKKQWTATWCAGCATADSARCVLMKGC"`

5. Modify the previous function to *ignore all ambiguities in calculations*. Use this list of ambiguous characters for this task: `ambig = ["B", "J", "N", "O", "X", "Z"]`. Test your function with the following sequence:`"APAPPPKKLRATNNYPOPPBXXXXXNTYGCTATLMQASDFTDTCATAGC"`


## Part II: File Input/Output

Files used in these exercises can be downloaded from the course website. Be sure to write your scripts in the same directory as these files!

1. Open the file `file1.txt` in read-mode, and print its contents to screen. Use the `.read()` method, which saves the contents of the file to a single string. Perform this task twice: once using `open` and `close`, and once using `with` control-flow.
	
2. Open the file `file1.txt` in read-mode, and save all lines in this file to a list using the `.readlines()` method. Write a new file called `upper_file1.txt` which contains the same contents of `file1.txt` but in upper-case. Try to do this task using a single for-loop.
	
3. Open the newly created file `upper_file1.txt` in read-mode. Loop over the file lines *without* using `.read()` or `.readlines()`, and print out lines as you loop.

4. Modify the previous for-loop to only print out lines in `upper_file1.txt` which contain at least (i.e. $$>=$$) 5 letter `E`'s. 
	
5. You should notice 20 files named `file1.txt, file2.txt, ..., file20.txt`. Write a for-loop to open each of these files (Hint: use the `range()` function to loop over file names). For each file, print each line that contains more than 25 characters.

6. Write another for-loop over the same 20 files. For each file, create a second file named `fileX_odd.txt` (where X=1-20) which contains only the *odd-numbered lines* from the original file. For this, use a *counter* in the for-loop that goes over file lines (this will count the line numbers), but be careful: Remember that python indexing starts from 0, but the first line is technically line #1! 

7. Convert our zoo-keeper dictionaries into a *comma-separated file* with the header `animal,vore,food`, and rows should contain corresponding information, i.e. `lion,carnivore,meat`. Perform this task with a *single* for-loop.
		
    ```python	
	category = {"lion": "carnivore", 
		        "gazelle": "herbivore", 
		        "anteater": "insectivore", 
		        "alligator": "homovore", 
		        "hedgehog": "insectivore", 
		        "cow": "herbivore", 
		        "tiger": "carnivore", 
		        "orangutan": "frugivore"}
		 
	feed = {"carnivore": "meat", 
		    "herbivore": "grass", 
		    "frugivore": "mangos", 
		    "homovore": "visitors", 
		    "insectivore": "termites"}
	```

8. Create a second zoo-keeper file by *converting* the CSV into a tab-separated file. Perform this task by reading in the CSV, *replacing* commas with tabs, where tabs can be created as the string `"\t"`. For example, the following snippet will replace all commas with tabs in a string called `mystring`: 

     ```python	
    mystring2 = mystring.replace(",", "\t")
	```
