                        <li><b>Google</b> is easily the most valuable resource for figuring things out. If you encounter an issue, chances are somebody else has also encountered it and has asked about it. Googling your error messages is one of the best debugging strategies there is. In particular, try to find links to the website <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">http://www.stackoverflow.com</a>. This forum-based website has all the answers, possibly literally (but they might be super snarky).</li>
                        <li>The popular websites <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>, <a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/">Rosalind</a>, and <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Languages-training-tutorials/1467-0.html">Lynda</a> are excellent for learning and practicing python and bioinformatics skills. UT has an account with Rosalind and Lynda, so if you're a UT student, simply log in with your standard UT credentials.</li>
                        <li>This paper, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004867">An Introduction to Programming for Bioscientists: A Python-based Primer</a>, provides a great resource for beginning Python programming.</li>
                        <li>The book <a href="http://practicalcomputing.org">Practical Computing for Biologists</a> by Haddock and Dunn provides a really thorough, entry-level overview of introductory computing concepts, including (but not limited to!) Unix and Python. The book's accompanying website is also regularly updated with important tips, examples, and errata.</li>
                        <li>If you want to go past just Python programming, this <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/">UNIX Tutorial for Beginners</a> is a great resource and starting point for getting comfortable with the command-line environment.</li>
